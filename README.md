My Nix Configuration
====================

I have just started out with Nixos, and this is the configuration for my entire setup (across devices). Nixos-config is where my system level configs live, and the rest are related to nix-shell and nixpkgs. I have borrowed HEAVILY from https://github.com/Fuuzetsu/nix-project-defaults, and Fuuzetsu deserves most of the credit for the way I use nix-shell to isolate development environments.

This is still a work in progress, and it needs a lot of cleaning up, refactoring, etc. But it is fully functional (I use it as my daily driver).

As always feel free to fork or submit pull requests.
